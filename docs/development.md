# Development

## Writing documentation

For this documentation, I use [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). You'll need a working Python interpreter to use it.

Assuming that you have it, first install the MkDocs:

=== "macOS / Linux"

	```sh
	pip3 install mkdocs-material
	```

=== "Windows"

	```powershell
	pip install mkdocs-material
	```

Then, to run the documentation site locally, you can use:

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

For the rest of features, check their documentation.
